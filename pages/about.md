I'm curently a full-time student at Baruch's Masters in Financial Engineering program.

This summer I am an intern at Autonomy Capital. In 2011 and 2012, the Autonomy Global Macro Fund has placed in the top twenty in the list of 100 best performing hedge funds as surveyed annually by Bloomberg Markets magazine.

I enjoy eating chocolate, programming in Linux, and learning new things.
